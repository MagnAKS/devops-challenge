The global load balancer routes traffic to the Tokyo region under normal conditions.
In the event of a disaster in the Tokyo region, an automated failover process updates the load balancer to route traffic to the Singapore region.
The Singapore region hosts a mirrored set of resources, including application infrastructure, database, and file storage.
Data is continuously replicated across regions for resilience and disaster recovery.

Disaster Recovery Plan

Monitoring and Alerting:
Implement robust monitoring and alerting using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. Set up alarms to detect any significant issues in the Tokyo region.

Disaster Recovery Runbooks:
Create runbooks and documentation detailing the steps to perform a failover to the secondary region.

Disaster Detection:
Implement a disaster detection mechanism. For example, you can use AWS CloudWatch Alarms to detect unusual events, or you can implement custom scripts or Lambda functions to monitor the Tokyo region's status.

Automated Failover:
When a disaster is detected (e.g., an earthquake in Tokyo), trigger an automated failover process. Update the global load balancer to route traffic to the Singapore region.

Application Configuration Update:
Update the application's configuration to point to the Singapore database and infrastructure.
